## A Bit About Me

:wave: Hi, I'm @Oluwanifesimi-simi — an Accounting graduate from Ekiti State University, Nigeria with a growing passion for data analysis.

🎓 I hold a degree in Accounting from Ekit State University, and I'm currently transitioning into the world of **data analysis**.

📊 My interest in data started during my emplyoment as an Opertaion Specialist/Office Accountant in a FinTech Company, where I realized how data can be used not just to record the past, but to shape decisions, which I already know and possess as an Accountant and forms the excess of Book Keeping. This inspired me to dive deeper into data tools and techniques.
 I discovered how much I enjoy working with data to uncover insights and support decision-making. While accounting taught me to be detail-oriented and analytical, data analysis opened a new world of possibilities for me.

To pursue this passion, I started my learning journey with Digital Skill-Up Africa (DSA) orgnised and put together by The Incubator, I also joined an internship program with MYT Consult, where I’m building hands-on experience in tools like Power BI and Tableau, as well as improving my ability to communicate data effectively.

🚀
- Power BI
- Tableau
- Excel for Data Analysis
- Data storytelling
- Problem-solving using real-world datasets
- Resaerch Methods

📚 Here on GitHub, I’m documenting my journey — from learning new tools to building small data projects that reflect real-world problems. I'm currently focusing on projects that involve data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling. I aim to achieve the best experience by:
- Practicing regularly
- Sharing what I learn
- Asking for feedback and help

💬 I'm excited to continue growing in this field, and I look forward to collaborating, learning, and sharing what I build along the way.
